    <h1>How do the Objective-C patterns we already know translate into Swift?</h1>
    <p>Patterns are your go-to code chunks; the things you know exactly how to do in Objective-C because you've framed code like it in all of your projects. Swift syntax seems to come pretty easy to iOS developers but we still need a lot of exploration to find the best reimplementations our favorite patterns in Swift.</p>
    <p>This is part of that exploration, listing patterns I've found while working in Swift and that others have shared elsewhere.</p>
